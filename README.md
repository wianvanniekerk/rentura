Rentura is a property rent estimation service for Real Estate Agents and Property Investors.

The user enters a privateproperty.co.za URL, specifically of properties listed for sale, on the /calculate page of Rentura.

Rentura analyses the property's features, including purchase price, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, floor size, levies / rates and taxes, and additional features such as swimming pool, parking spaces etc.

Rentura results should by no means be used as the final determination of rent prices. Always consult a real estate agent for conclusive estimates.
